But why?  League tables don't explain this and commentators are vague.  What good are comparisons if they don't improve student outcomes through better understanding and better policies? This study shows why inequality persists in six countries.  It highlights the role of curriculum as a vehicle for distinguishing between students in more or less sharp ways and of selective schooling as a vehicle for gaining access to the most discriminating paths in the curriculum.  It points to ways in which schooling can operate more equitably without sacrificing quality.,3301,EDUCATION STUDIES,"$456,000",,,,,,,,,"$120,000","$98,000","$148,000","$90,000",,,,,
